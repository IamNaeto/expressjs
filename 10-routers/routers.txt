Routers
- An express router is used to organise all of our requests
- It helps us to group our api endpoints based on domain.
- The domain can be user domain which handles everything related to users such creating a user, updating a user, deleting a user etc, or product domain for everything related to products.
- import { Router } from "express" is a function to call to create an instance of an express router
- The router instance has almost all the same exact methods and properties that the express app instance has such as the get, post, delete etc. The router is like a mini application in our entire express app that can group together all of our request
